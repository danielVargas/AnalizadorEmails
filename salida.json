According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degreesFahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwesttemperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.     What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we weresupposed to have, said one Northwest power marketer. Since theweather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from theEl Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.     Gas prices are declining causing western daily power pricesto fall, said one Northwest power trader.     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fellto $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.     PSC of New Mexicos 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plantwas shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduledto restart this weekend.     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.-Robert ScalabrinoPJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-daypower prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-NewJersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts andfalling natural gas prices, traders said.     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at westernPJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with tradesranging from $62.00-$76.00.     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.forecast tomorrows high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degreesFahrenheit, up 7 degrees from todays expected high. Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.     Most of the days activity took place in the early part ofthe morning, said one PJM-based trader. By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-$92.00.     ~-Karyn RispoliMid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continentnext-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revisedwarmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on theCincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as themarket opened down to $59.00 after options expired.     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power onthe Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 loweron average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17lower at $65.00-$100.00.     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predictedhigh temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normalin Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next sevendays, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulledprices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.     The weathers moderating and gas is down, so youve gotpeople coming to their senses, one trader said. These are muchmore realistic prices.     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if theoutlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power fordelivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00yesterday.     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plungedwith warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmissioncapacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less insouthern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.     Whats happening is the people who dont have firmtransmission are getting into the market early and buying at thosehigh prices since they have no choice, one MAPP trader said.     Then youve got some people who were lucky enough to get afirm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd pricesfell off, he said, and bought from them at those lower prices,causing the huge gap between the days high and low trade.-Ken FahnestockSoutheast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- SoutheastU.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather wasforecast for the region this week, traders said.     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced sincemany large population centers like Atlanta will see temperaturesclimb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.     There was nothing going on in Florida today, said onesouthern energy trader. Everything was going to markets in thenorth.     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida intomarkets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authoritygrid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.     Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled asforecasts came out, said on Entergy power trader. Prices,declined to $60 and less.     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak tradeswere noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recentestimates.     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weatherforecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this weekcaused prices to decline in the region.     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather wasthe main culprit behind lower prices.     The cold weathers backing off, said one SPP utilitytrader. It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday andtoday its about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it wasbitter cold and today it was just plain cold.     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, thoughthe Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. SouthernSPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.-Brian WharyU.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices inthe U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected toincrease household consumption for space heating, traders said.     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by theElectricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01pounds a megawatt-hour.     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degreesto 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather ServicesCorp. in the U.S.     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.     December continued to fall amid a combination of positionclosing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand willnot rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds amegawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterdays last trade.     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line withexpectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continueto stifle demand, traders said.     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds amegawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds amegawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds amegawatt-hour.     Open positions on many short-term structures will likelyforce many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures willprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can moreeasily be assessed.-Nick LivingstoneNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power priceson the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher todayas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterdays closing trade on 1,076megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.     The markets been waiting for this day for a long time, aStockholm-based trader said. For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasnt lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.     Thursdays system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterdays last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.     Vattenfalls Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.     Todays rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtodays news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT=0F$ - daily.pdf","popularity":"-1","urgency":"0"},{"Message-ID":"<11483563.1075855665726.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"976698240.0","from":"aod@newsdata.com","to":"western.price.survey.contacts@ren-6.cais.net","subject":"pecial report coming from NewsData","body":"Our Sacramento correspondent just exited a news conference fromGov.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasnt enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldnt comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldnt order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISOs operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. Its still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South BayPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the states power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldnt result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).Dukes 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representativesin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.   -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-LinePower Plants(This article was originally published Wednesday)   By Jessica Berthold   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRESLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the states powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldnt perform an unannounced full inspectionof the companys 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plants full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didnt know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.Wed be happy to put our units back, provided we dont get sued for it,Thomas said. Its not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistricts authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.   Dynegys El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.I guess our position is, Gee, were sorry you dont believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, thats fine, said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.Weve been doing all we can to get back in service, Lednicky said. Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegys explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.

Crocker <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe fiscals.  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?

As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus.

In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PMTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do listFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group.  Weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PMTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do listFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group.

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesnt make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enrons belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.

Crocker <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe fiscals.  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investors input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, fiscals at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investors input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC - winmail.dat","popularity":"0","urgency":"0"},{"Message-ID":"<12266754.1075855668006.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"969966060.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"ina.rangel@enron.com","subject":"","body":"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 02:00 PM ---------------------------RescheduleChairperson: Richard BurchfieldSent by: Cindy CicchettiStart: 10/03/2000 02:30 PMEnd: 10/03/2000 03:30 PMDescription: Gas Physical/Financail Positions -

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  regions growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                        We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall, said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the companys existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads, said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                        It is probably the largest data center park in the country, boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                        After building Exodus first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space, said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,                  said Seattle City Lights Royer. The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.

Now that we have had several traders managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those who are managing the books believe in the models results.

InformationThis is a reminder !!!  If you havent taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.With Enrons rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser.The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.

The WSCC data, which is dicey and we dont have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation.  You are pulling scheduled.  If someone doesnt schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While they dont split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number.  The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.  Id like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.Lets talk.","popularity":"1","urgency":"0"},{"Message-ID":"<1735234.1075855670847.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"960473820.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"jeff.richter@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com","subject":"","body":"Check out NP Gen & Load.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but Ill point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so Ill know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and Ill take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019.   (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP-Kingsgate. Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, heres the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be an operational reason why this occurred that Im not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought Id bring it to your attention just in case theres something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product.As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we implement our strategy in California.Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main contacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of their PGAs and see if there is an opportunity.As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Laird","popularity":"1","urgency":"0"},{"Message-ID":"<16945.1075855671306.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"956832000.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"hargr@webtv.net","subject":"Re: #30","body":"Kay & Neal,Thanks for remembering my birthday.

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peakpower dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.     Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causingprices to decline, said one Southwest trader.     According to Weather Services Corp., of LexingtonMassachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 astraders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.     Traders said that Arizonas Public Service Co. 1,270-megawattPalo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increasedproduction to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of ascheduled refueling outage that began March 31.     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak powerslumped 47.5 percent from Fridays Sunday-Monday package to aBloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degreesFahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with coolingdemand 84 percent below normal.     We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which iscausing temperatures to drop, said one Northwest trader.     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peakpower fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at$175.00-$228.00.     According the California Independent System Operator todaysforecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.-Robert ScalabrinoNortheast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase inavailable generation coupled with less weather-related demand,caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as muchas 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degreeFahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating andcooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peakpower scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloombergvolume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 fromFriday.     Theres just no weather out there, said one PJM-basedtrader. Theres no need for air conditioning, and no need forheating. As far as I can tell, its going to be that way all weeklong.     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000megawatts through Friday.     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause forthe dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned toservice today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected tohit the grid tomorrow.     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New YorkPower Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2nuclear power facilities.     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion ofa refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 atfull power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are ownedand operated by Niagara Mohawk.     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to$51.25 and $40.00 indices.     ~-Karyn RispoliWeather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peakpower prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as highweather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,traders said.     Its supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (TennesseeValley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergyto there, one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because ofthat.     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesdayinto the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from theSoutheast was expected to remain high into next week.     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.     Things should continue along these lines for the rest ofthe week, because theres enough power to get down there but notso much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices, anECAR trader said.     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand fromthe Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,though traders said transmission problems limited volume.     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at theChicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, withtrades from $32.00-$40.00.     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices alsoclimbed today, showing the largest increase in the region asabove-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problemsisolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northernMAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southernhalf of the region at $45.00-$52.00.     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.predicted tomorrows high temperature would be 85 degrees inMinneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.     Theres no available transmission from ComEd, and problemsgetting power out of Amerens grid too, one MAPP trader said.Its likely to cause problems all week, since its hot here anddown in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).-Ken FahnestockSoutheast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spotelectricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned tomajor Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based WeatherServices Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlantavicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5degrees higher than todays projected high. Cooler weather isexpected to begin Wednesday.     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Councilregional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour fromequivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded anaverage of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amidtrades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firmenergy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traderscomplained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.     Theres just no overnight load to do anything with thesupply we have, said one Texas-based utility power trader.Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest weve seen is85 degrees, so thats about 10 degrees below normal for us.     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power fortomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were doneat a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traderssaid forecasts for cooler weather through much of the Southstarting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at$35-$36.     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energyat $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region becausepower from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloombergindex of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for thebalance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though latertrades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergypower was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traderssaid.     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week wasbid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy forthe balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new tradeswere noted.-Brian WharyU.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy sellinginterest, traders said.     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds amegawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, beforeclosing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower thanFriday.     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start ofthe month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from onetrading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it wasshort. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from oppositionfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supportingprice levels, traders said.     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather wasexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower productioncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday afterlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gasfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence sincethe start of last week.     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamentalreasons for price movements because of the immaturity of themarket, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,they said.-Amal HalawiNordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-termelectricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushedto buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amidlimited hydro-supply, traders said.     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an alltime high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.     The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; nowyou have to pay higher prices to develop positions, an Oslo-based trader said. Im surprised that even at the peak of thesnow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices aresteadily climbing.     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percentabove normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a morerealistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wetoutlooks.     Tuesdays system area average price was set below expecationsof 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,down 7.45 kroner from todays price. Still, traders said this wasa high spot price for this time of the year.     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hourwith 140 megawatts exchanged.

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.","popularity":"1","urgency":"0"},{"Message-ID":"<25550120.1075855693958.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"988967880.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com, ","subject":"Re: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as compared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I hope this helps.

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)","popularity":"0","urgency":"0"},{"Message-ID":"<5875069.1075855695485.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"986205120.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"pallen70@hotmail.com","subject":"","body":"https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/","popularity":"-1","urgency":"1"},{"Message-ID":"<25151037.1075855695507.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"985852860.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"jacquestc@aol.com","subject":"Re:","body":"JacquesI am out of the office for the rest of the week.

I have received estimates structured as follows:  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment  2%- overhead  4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about such a low return.

Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or Cellulose?5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didnt know the difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron railings?15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except for change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.  We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugos number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.  Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.I have summarized our issues as follows:1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:     Pro-Forma                           Banks Adjustment     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Banks revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provideequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:     Land -                   $1,121,670     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000     Cash Equity              $1,419,268     Total                    $2,955,9387.

Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials.

Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs.

All parties are GPs but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.

It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)

I have shifted to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.  The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  I dont know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesnt give me the time to manage this property.

Cash NeedsHighlights:SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsHighlights:SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under= such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)Highlights:As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20Our comments are summarized as follows:The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisHighlights:In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan","popularity":"0","urgency":"1"},{"Message-ID":"<5722531.1075855698441.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"315514800.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"c@enron.com","subject":"","body":"George,In response to your ideasTime and cost1.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip  ","popularity":"1","urgency":"1"},{"Message-ID":"<23755959.1075855698595.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"980504100.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"cbpres@austin.rr.com","subject":"RE: Loan for San Marcos","body":"George,We should hear from the bank in Houston on Monday.The best numbers and times to reach me:work 713-853-7041fax 713-464-2391cell 713-410-4679home 713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com (home)pallen@enron.com (work)I am usually at work M-F 7am-5:30pm.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would retain $106 million (of what, Im not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December (and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment. SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due on 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&Es purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. Traders do that all the time; theyre looking forward, said William Burson, a trader. It makes the market for natural gas. But the markets response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Associations director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. Its a little frustrating that they dont take the time to understand what we are reporting, McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the markets speculators for the rise in gas prices. Its my firm belief ... that todays gas prices are being manipulated, Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winters startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. Were passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over, said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. Theres been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change, said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous Decembers bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. Its the talk of the town here, he said. A year ago that wasnt a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didnt make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. Its all about the weather, said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders dont need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity theyre trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Associations weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summers unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the associations McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didnt share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if Decembers cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. I was getting worried, he said. Then suddenly the market turned when Januarys weather turned warmer. Wednesdays storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energys gas purchasing practices. Consumers are taking all the risk, Micheel said. Its time to consider some changes.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.

In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governors staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governors ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments:Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by 02 and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming.  Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a couple of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos: (Jeff, again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.","popularity":"1","urgency":"1"},{"Message-ID":"<24305810.1075855699452.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"977991540.0","from":"phillip.allen@enron.com","to":"john.lavorato@enron.com","subject":"","body":"Trading ProfitsP.

If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1.  Examine LDCs incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future       replacement cost.  The result is that the LDCs sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                    This creates a shortage in later months. 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.  Investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally.                        Specific questions should include:    1.  Why in March 00-May 00  werent total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFOs on weekends that push away too much gas from Socals system.         I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                     LDCs.
